# Evade - A Space Shooter Game for Arduboy by Modus Create

This is an Arduboy game, written as a gift for [Modus Create](http://moduscreate.com) clients for the 2016 holiday season.

Watch the cinematic trailer that we produced for the game on Vimeo:

You can also listen to the music for the first stage of the game on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/djliquidice/modus-create-arduboy-game-stage1-track).

## Quick Start

You will need an Arduboy, which you can get from:

* [Arduboy](https://www.arduboy.com/store/products/arduboy) (different case colors available)
* [Adafruit] (https://www.adafruit.com/products/3264) (white case only)

Arduboy is Arduino based. A program for the Arduino is referred to as a "Sketch".  To install our game on your Arduboy, you will need to get the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

Follow these steps to be able to compile the code:

1. Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and install it
2. Start the Arduino IDE
3. Load the `arduboy-game.ino` sketch from the `arduboy/` subdirectory of this project
4. In the Arduino IDE menu, go to "Sketch...Include Library...Manage Libraries" and add the Arduboy library version 1.1.1.
5. In the Arduino IDE menu, go to "Tools...Board" and select either `Arduino Leonardo` or `Arduboy`
6. In the Arduino IDE menu, select to "Sketch...Verify/Compile"

This should compile and verify the Arduino sketch. You should see output in the lower window similar to this:

    Done compiling.

    Sketch uses 28,668 bytes (99%) of program storage space. Maximum is 28,672 bytes.
    Global variables use 1,898 bytes (74%) of dynamic memory, leaving 662 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2,560 bytes.

When you plug a device into your USB port you need to set the *Port* from the
*Tools* menu.

The *Tick* icon can be used to verify the code prior to uploading. The *Arrow* button uploads the sketch to
the device.  

## Troubleshooting

If the Arduboy doesn't upload your sketch, try the following procedure:

* Turn off device.
* Press upload, on ide.
* Then hold reset.
* While holding reset press power, then let go of reset.  It will work.

Alternatively:

* Press and -hold- reset button (paperclip)
* Hit upload
* Wait for the “Sketch uses xxx bytes” message
* Count to 4
* Release reset button

## Viewing Compiler Output in Arduino IDE

By default the Arduino IDE does not show the output of the compiler as it compiles your code.  If you want to see this:

* Open up Arduino IDE Preferences dialog
* Find the "Show verboase output during" options
* Check the "compilation" check box
* Select "Default" from the "Compiler warnings" drop down
* Click "OK" to save your changes

## Image Conversion

We used [this tool](https://github.com/yyyc514/img2ard) to convert images.  It has its own documentation.

## JavaScript Tool for Converting Strings to Bitmap Font Representations

We created a small JavaScript tool (`tools/text_generator.js` in this repo) to convert arrays of strings into arrays of integers representing the characters in the bitmap font that we use.  This can be run directly in [JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).
